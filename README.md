1. What is a pragmatic trial?
2. Asking good causal questions
3. Understanding causal graphs
4. Intention-to-treat effects, but better
5. Per-protocol effect, done right
6. Guidelines for causal inference from pragmatic trials
7. Practicum for survival analysis

# Practicum overview

The practicum portion was jointly developed by Eleanor Murray, Ellen Caniglia, and Lucia Petito. Code for the practicum is available in R, SAS, and Stata.The data for the practicum are a simulated version of the Coronary Drug Project trial. Please ensure that you have downloaded the correct version of the dataset for your preferred coding language. The practicum instructions are provided as a single file regardless of programming language. A solutions manual will be available upon completion of the live version of the workshop.

If you plan to use R during the workshop, please ensure that you have the packages installed by running the first set of code before the workshop. This will ensure there are no problems with accessing packages during the session.
